Sure, I can help you break down this file into smaller, more manageable components. Hereâ€™s a suggestion on how you could structure your files:

WeatherAPI.jsx: This file could contain the logic for fetching the weather data. It would include the useState and useEffect hooks, the fetchWeather function, and the API key and URL.
WeatherForm.jsx: This file could contain the form for submitting the city. It would include the handleSubmit function and the form JSX.
WeatherDisplay.jsx: This file could contain the logic for displaying the weather data. It would include the weatherComponents object, the weathers array, and the JSX for displaying the weather data.
Info.jsx: This file would import and use the WeatherAPI, WeatherForm, and WeatherDisplay components. It would also contain the useState hooks for city, error, and weatherData.
This way, each file has a specific purpose and is easier to manage and understand. If you need help with the actual code for these files, let me know! Iâ€™d be happy to assist further. ğŸ˜Š
